My ICS 173 final project uses the Youth Tobacco Survey dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle.
I experimented with some of the things we learned in the class. I did not start out with an end goal in mind, but wanted to see what I could drill into in the data and what might be interesting to visualize. 
Of course, there is so much more I could do with this great data, and I hope to keep experimenting and learning!
